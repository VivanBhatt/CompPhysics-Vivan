HW3 Task:

1. Sections 10.0 and 10.5 of Numerical Recipes on Minimization or Maximization of Functions discuss the downhill simplex method due to Nelder and Mead. 
2. The reference for their original article is - Nelder, J.A., and Mead, R. 1965, “A Simplex Method for Function Minimization,” Computer Journal, vol. 7, pp. 308–313.
3. As seen in Figure 10.5.1, the four possible outcomes for a step in the downhill simplex method are (a) Reflection, (b) Reflection and Expansion, (c) Contraction, and (d) Multiple Contraction.
4. Section 9.2.1 discusses Ridder's method of root finding based on his article "A New Algorithm for Computing a Single Root of a Real Continuous Function" on pages 979 and 980 of vol. CAS-26 of the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems. The following article on page 980 is "Monotonic Magnitude Response with Equal Ripple Sensitivity" by D.M. Rabrenovic and Z.J. Aleksic.
